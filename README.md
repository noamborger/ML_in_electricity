# ML in electricity
Commercial electricity users in Ukraine are required to state how much electricity
they are going to use in each following month and buy it accordingly. However, if
they don't use all of it they practically lose money. On the other hand, the fee for
excessive usage is twice(and sometimes three times) than the regular fee by the
law. According to recent statistics, AWDP increased to UAH 585 per MWh in 2015.

As a result, these users are seeking the most accurate estimation(or prediction) of
the following month's usage.

Hence, this study's aim is to predict, with at least 95% accuracy, the electricity
usage of commercial entities.

To achieve this kind of accuracy, this research will include Machine Learning
algorithms that would take into account various factors that could affect the
power consumption, such as: weather conditions, factory machines' power usage,
etc.
